1. Install Xampp with latest PHP 8.1
2. After installing Xampp, go to C:\xampp\htdocs\ and paste your web files into a folder for example
C:\xampp\htdocs\ckc-inventory where ckc-inventory contains your webfiles and not a folder.
3. Start your xampp webserver.
4. Go to phpmyadmin by typing http://localhost/phpmyadmin or in the xampp control panel you can click on
Admin button on the MySQL row and it will open the phpmyadmin page
5. Create a new database by clicking "New" on the left sidebar and call the database "ckc-inventory".
6. After creating database, click on the database you just created and click on the import panel on the 
navbar.
7. Click on "browse" and your file explorer will open. Go to where your web files are at
C:\xampp\htdocs\ckc-inventory and select the file "ckc-inventory.sql"
8. Now scroll to the bottom of the page and untick enable foreign key checks to avoid problems. Then click
on the Go button at the bottom of the page.
9. Once the database has finished importing, visit http://localhost/ckc-inventory/public on your web address to access
your website.
